## Introduction

This API provides functionalities to manage a library system. It includes endpoints for user authentication and book management, built using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB with Mongoose.

## Technologies used
- NodeJs
- Express
- MongoDb
- Mongoose
- JsonWebToken

## Project Structure
```
root/
â”œâ”€â”€ config/
â”œâ”€â”€ controllers/
â”œâ”€â”€ models/
â””â”€â”€ routes/
```

The system follows a client-server architecture and utilizes a MongoDB database managed with Mongoose to handle data storage.

The server is built using Express, and you can find its code in /controllers, /models, and /routes. The client-side implementation is not explicitly mentioned but would generally be included in a separate directory if present.
